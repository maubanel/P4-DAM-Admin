Tips for Perforce Admins

## LSU Changes Hostname
* It seems like that on Mac OSX the school is altering the result of HOSTNAME and make it look like a different computer when off the LSU network.  For example my mac hostname at home is: Marcâ€™s MacBook Pro but at school my hostname is: 88-66-5a-0e-1c-d6.wlan.lsu.edu
  

## .p4ignore

Place in root folder above project directorty with `.uproject` project name.  Right click and download a linked file [copy here](.p4ignore). Because the folders have no slash in front of them it is any folder names `Saved/` not just root of the `.p4ignore` file.

```
Saved/
Intermediate/
DerivedDataCache/
*.pdb
obj/
*.vcxproj
*.sln
*-Debug.*
FileOpenOrder/
*.DS_Store
```

- Assign `.p4ignore` on each project by adding `p4 set P4IGNORE=.p4ignore`.  Add and submit to repository.

- Stop anyone from creating a new user by typing in command line: `p4 configure set dm.user.noautocreate=2`.  You should receive a response of _For server 'any', configuration variable 'dm.user.noautocreate' set to '2'_ if succesful.



# Issue regarding version control not loading by default
Not saving ini with version control
```
I had to change Saved/Config/Windows/SourceControlSettings.ini to this:

[SourceControl.SourceControlSettings]
UseGlobalSettings=True

It was set to false prior. Once that was done, I loaded the editor, then set up source control again.

[SourceControl.SourceControlSettings]
UseGlobalSettings=True
Provider=Perforce

[PerforceSourceControl.PerforceSourceControlSettings]
Port=[IP ADDRESS]:[PORT]
UserName=[Username]
Workspace=[Workspace]
HostOverride=
```

### Files Check Out by Depot
Someone has accidentally checkout files and will not check them back in.  You can force them to revert with admin privileges.

* `p4 revert -C WORKSPACENAME //DEPOTNAME/...`

### Project Files are Locked
Occasionally project files are locked and no one has them checked out in Unreal.
Run `p4 retype -t binary //DEPOT/...`.  This will unlock **ALL** the files in the repo

### Ignored Files in Depot
There are files/folders in the depot that should be ignored.

Run `p4 obliterate //DEPOTNAME/FilePaths...` to test what files will be obliterated.  If the results are correct then type

`p4 obliterate -y //DEPOTNAME/FilePaths...`

### If typemap is wrong (.uasset should be binary+l), retype all the files in the project by going to a root folder on a workspace and running

`p4 edit -t auto ...`

Submit changes to the server.

### Creating New Branch

Performs a copy and submit in one command when creating new streams.

`p4 populate //PROJECT NAME/BRANCH_SOURCE/... //PROJECT_NAME/BRANCH_DESTINATION/...`

### List All Checked Out Files
`p4 opened -a //depot/Your/Location/...`


### DAM
* To limit DAM users from creating projects or repositories go to **Teams** dashboard and click on the user proflie on thg etop right.  Click on **Company settings**.  Go to **Features** and adjust the settings to limit projects.
